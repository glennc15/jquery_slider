jQuery slider exercises

This is a jQuery slider I made by following the videos in The Odin Project, jQuery 101, Assignment 4 (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/jquery-basics). 

My basic slider is working per the videos.

Now I want to make these further modificaitons for additional practice:

- Replace "prev" and "next" buttons with CSS buttons. Use github to create a branch to make changes.

- Make the slider slide from the edge of the screen. (new Git branch?).
